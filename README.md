# frm.js
Client side scripts for loading and rendering Fallout's FRM files.

## TODO
*   <del>single image sprite instead of many images</del>  
    frm use offsets to save spaces, recaculate sprite width and combine them into one big image is not a good idea.
*   separate pure frm data from sprite
*   cross domain request
*   read frm without all 6 directions
*   now it's a jQuery plugin, but it doesn't do much
