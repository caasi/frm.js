# frm.js
Client side scripts for loading and rendering Fallout's FRM files.

## Depends on

*   [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) 1.7.1
*   [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
*   [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)

## Thanks to

*   Critters come from [Fallout 2 Restoration Project](http://www.killap.net/)
*   [JH Fallout Font]  
    Warning: use this font will sale you soul to the author!
*   NovaRain  
    The man who makes me love Fallout series deeper, and help me test this project.

## TODO
*   <del>single image sprite instead of many images</del>  
    frm use offsets to save spaces, recaculate sprite width and combine them into one big image is not a good idea.
*   separate pure frm data from sprite
*   cross domain request
*   read frm without all 6 directions
*   now it's a jQuery plugin, but it doesn't do much
