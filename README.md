# frm.js
Client side scripts for loading and rendering Fallout's FRM files.

## TODO
*   separate pure frm data from sprite
*   single image sprite instead of many images
*   cross domain request
*   read fr[0-5]
*   read frm without all 6 directions
*   now it's a jQuery plugin, but it doesn't do much
